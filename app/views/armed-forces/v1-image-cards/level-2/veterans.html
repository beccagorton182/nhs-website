Find healthcare and welfare support dedicated to veterans, non-mobilised reservists, families and carers.     </p>

<p>
  You are a veteran if you have actively served in the armed forces for at least 1 day. This includes reservists who are not currently mobilised.
  </p>

  <p>
    All veterans, family members and carers can access a range of specialist healthcare and support created to provide treatment and care for many different problems.
    </p>

    <h2>Support for health problems not caused by service</h2>

    <p>
      If you have a new or existing health problem that is not caused by your time in the armed forces, you can use regular NHS services to get treatment.
      </p>

      <p>
        You will only be able to use to specialist veteran services if your health problem was caused by your time in the armed forces.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is important to <a href="../../register-gp">register with a GP surgery</a> once you have left the armed forces. A GP can help refer you to NHS or dedicated veteran specialist services.

                <h3>Waiting lists and priority treatment</h3>

                <p>
                  If you have a health problem not caused by your time in the armed forces, you may go on to a waiting list before you can receive full treatment from the NHS.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    If you have a health problem caused by your time in the armed forces, you may be able to receive NHS care quicker than normal through priority treatment for veterans. However, this is not guaranteed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Check with a GP if you can receive priority treatment for the NHS service care you need.
                      </p>

                              <p>
                                There are many dedicated Ministry of Defence (MoD) and NHS services dedicated to treating and supporting veterans who have health problems caused by their time in the armed forces.

                                  The Veterans Trauma Network (VTN) provides care and treatment to veterans who were injured during their time in the armed forces.
