      Mental health problems are common and can affect anyone, including veterans, serving personnel and their families. It is important to get help and support if you or someone you know is struggling with mental health.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some people delay getting help with their mental health for a number of reasons, such as trying to cope alone, fear of criticism, embarrassment or feeling that the NHS will not understand.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many different ways to get help that take you and your situation into account. Finding the right support for you is important.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you need support for a specific mental health condition, you can find information through our <a href="../level-3/conditions2">A-Z of mental health conditions</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you want help from a charity, you can <a href="">find local or specific mental health charities</a> or <a href="../level-3/mh-charities2">get help from armed forces specific charities</a>.
