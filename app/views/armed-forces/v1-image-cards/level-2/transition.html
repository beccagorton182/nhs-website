<h2>What happens to my healthcare when I leave the armed forces?</h2>

<p>
When you leave the armed forces, you will move from dedicated serving personnel healthcare to civilian and veteran healthcare.
 </p>

 <p>
   Most of your treatment will come through the NHS, but there are also dedicated healthcare services designed to support veterans injured while serving in the armed forces.
   </p>


<h3>What information will I be given?</h3>

<p>
You will be given an NHS welcome letter explaining the process of transferring from a military GP to an NHS GP. This will encourage you to register with a GP and a civilian dentist as soon as possible. The welcome letter also explains what a GP can do to help you.
</p>

<p>
  You will also be given a form (FMed133A) which contains important details for your GP surgery, including a summary of medical treatments, vaccinations and specialist care received.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may also receive a paper copy of your summary medical records. If you do not, it is best to ask for one.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have specialist healthcare needs, including mental health, you may be referred to specialist services so you can receive the care you need straight away.
      </p>

<h3>Leaving the armed forces as a commonwealth veteran</h3>

<p>
If you are a member of the commonwealth armed forces, the process of transitioning from military healthcare is different.
  </p>

<p>
  In order to receive free NHS healthcare, you must gain indefinite leave by applying to settle in the UK. You must apply within 2 years of your discharge from the armed forces.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is best to apply as soon as possible. 10 weeks prior to your discharge is the recommended time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The process may differ depending on how long you served and where you served, as well as if you family members who are also looking to settle in the UK.

<h2>Actions to take when moving to civilian healthcare</h2>

  <p>
If you are unsure of what to do when you leave the armed forces, there are several actions you can take to make your transition from military to civilian healthcare a lot easier.
    </p>

    <h3>Register with an NHS GP surgery</h3>

    <p>
      Your NHS welcome letter will encourage you to register with an NHS GP surgery.

  <p>It is important you do this at the earliest chance you have.</p>
</div>

<!-- <p>
  It is important you do this at the earliest chance you have.
  </p> -->

  <p>
    The sooner you register, the easier it is for your GP surgery to receive your medical records from Defence Medical Services (DMS). If you do not register with a GP surgery soon, it could take several months for the surgery to get your full summary medical records.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once your GP surgery has your full records, a GP can give you better healthcare advice, as well as quickly refer you to any specialist care you might need.
      </p>

      <h3>Get your GP surgery access to your medical care records</h3>

      <p>
        When you first visit a GP at your GP surgery, it is important to give them the form you receive when leaving the armed forces, as well as a copy of your summary medical records if they do not already have one.
        </p>

        <p>
          This gives the GP information on your healthcare during the armed forces so they can make sure you receive the healthcare you need.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can also give them your NHS welcome letter. This provides information to them about how to help you.
            </p>

            <h4>What if my summary medical records copy is lost?</h4>

            <p>
              If you or your GP surgery has lost your summary medical record copy, your GP can request a new one.
              </p>

              <p>
                Contact details for this request are on the form you received when you left the armed forces. If your GP does not have the form, they can also be foundâ€¦

                  </p>

                  <h3>Tell a GP to record you as a veteran in your NHS medical notes</h3>

                  <p>
                    When you first visit your GP surgery, it is important to tell the GP you see that you are a veteran. Ask them to record this in your NHS medical notes if it is not already there.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Being flagged as a veteran means you are more likely to receive specialist veteran care and consideration, and GPs are more likely to refer you to specialist veteran services if you need them.
                      </p>

                      <h3>Register with a dentist</h3>

                      <p>
                        Your NHS welcome letter will also encourage you to register with a dentist.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          It is important to do this as soon as possible.
