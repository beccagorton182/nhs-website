  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">What this data shows:</h2>
  <p>Whether people having this operation at this hospital are more or less likely than expected to stay overnight.</p>

  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">How the data is gathered:</h2>
 
  
    <p>This type of operation can be carried out as a day case, which is when the patient goes home on the same day that they have the operation. This measure is based on the percentage of recent operations that were carried out as day cases to determine the likelihood that a patient will stay overnight for this procedure. Some patients may not be suitable for day-case treatment if, for example, they have complex medical problems or if there is nobody to look after them at home.</p>
    


  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">When the data is shown:</h2>
  <p>Data is shown where the number of operations carried out is equal to or greater than 30, for the 12 month period shown.</p>
  
  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">More information about the data source:</h2>
  <p>The data for this indicator are sourced from The Commissioning Data Set (CDS), which holds data on all admissions to hospitals in England.</p>

  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">How often the data is updated:</h2>

    <p><strong>Indicator construction: day-case rate 'likelihood of staying overnight'</strong></p>
    <p>Some hospital procedures can be carried out as day cases. A “day case” is where the patient is discharged from hospital on the same day as their operation so they don’t stay overnight. The proportion of patients who are admitted to hospital and discharged the same day for a selected procedure is calculated and expressed as a percentage for each trust, called the day-case rate. The day-case rates are ranked from highest to lowest and grouped into three bands; the lowest 25% of the dataset are banded as “high likelihood” of an overnight stay, that is, a low day-case rate. Values lying within the middle 50% of the dataset are banded as a “medium likelihood” of an overnight stay and those lying within the highest 25% of the dataset are banded as “low likelihood” of an overnight stay, so a high day-case rate. The analyses are performed using routinely collected hospital data that are analysed to take into account factors that can affect day-case rates such as the ages of the patients or underlying medical conditions. The measure is calculated at NHS trust level. Some hospitals may treat day-case patients in the outpatient department and these patients are not included in this measure.</p>
    <p><strong>Data sources and data period</strong></p>
    <p>Day-case rate indicators are based on the analysis of Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data. HES data refer to consultant episodes (the continuous period during which the patient is under the care of one consultant) and admissions or “spells". Data are filtered so that the indicator includes only admissions where the patient was aged 19 years or older. Patients with a primary diagnosis of cancer in the episode that the procedure was carried out in are not included in the rate unless the procedure for which the rate is being calculated is specifically for cancer. The data is refreshed monthly using HES data six months in arrears. The observed figure is the proportion of admissions within the 12-month period where the patient is classed as a day case, the length of stay is zero days and the procedure is for the relevant procedure being measured. For more detail about how data are filtered and the clinical codes used to identify each type of procedure please see day case rate methodology.</p>
