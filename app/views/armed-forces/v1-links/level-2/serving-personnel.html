Find information and support about healthcare for serving personnel and mobilised reservists.     </p>

<p>
  The Ministry of Defence (MoD) is responsible for providing general healthcare and some areas of specialist healthcare for most serving personnel and mobilised reservists.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are a non-mobilised reservist, you are likely to get support and treatment in the same way as a veteran.

<h2>Healthcare on active duty</h2>

<h3>General care while serving</h3>

<p>
  General and day-to-day check-ups and treatments for serving personnel and mobilised reservists both overseas and in the UK are provided by the Defence Medical Services (DMS).
  </p>

  <p>
    The DMS is made up of the Royal Navy Medical Services, the Army Medical Services, the Royal Air Force Medical Services and Headquarters DMS Group.
    </p>



    <p>
      General care you receive through the DMS includes:
      </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    treatment from GP services (general practice)
    </li>
    <li>
      dentistry
      </li>
      <li>
        occupational medicine
        </li>
        <li>
          community mental health services
          </li>
  </ul>


<h3>Returning to the UK for specialist treatment</h3>

<p>
  Your DMS GP will decide if you need to return to the UK for specialist treatment and can refer you to hospital care through the NHS.
  </p>

<p>
  The Defence Medical Welfare Service (DMWS) can visit you regularly when you are in the UK. They will help you with your day to day needs, and maintain a link with your unit.
  </p>


  <h4>Emergency specialist treatment</h4>

<p>
  You will return to the UK for specialist emergency treatment if you:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      have a serious injury from a military operation
      </li>
      <li>
        have a medical emergency that requires specialist care, such as cancer treatment
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The main treatment centre for most seriously injured serving personnel deployed on military operations is the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM). This is a specialist centre provided by the DMS and the NHS.
      </p>

<p>

The RCDM is based at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham (QECB). Most injured serving personnel returning to the UK will be taken to QECB.

  </p>

  <p>
    If you need treatment for other medical emergencies, you will go to an NHS hospital that can provide the specialist care you need.
    </p>

    <h4>Routine specialist treatment</h4>

    <p>
      Your DMS GP may refer you to routine specialist treatment in the UK if it easier to treat you there than overseas.
      </p>

      <p>
        They will refer you to an NHS hospital for treatment by specialists in the area of your injury or medical need.
        </p>

        <h3>Rehabilitation services</h3>

        <p>
          The MoD provides many rehabilitation services across the UK. These are known as Primary Care Rehabilitation Facilities (PCRFs) and Regional Rehabilitation Units (RRUs).
          </p>

          <p>
            Most serving personnel will receive physiotherapy and exercise rehabilitation through PCRFs. If you have long-term injuries, you will be referred to an RRU.
            </p>

            <p>
              Serving personnel can also receive support through the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC). This is a specialist centre committed to supporting serving personnel in their rehabilitation from complex injuries and trauma.

                <h3>Non-urgent and routine hospital care</h3>

                <p>
                  If you are based in England and need non-urgent or routine hospital treatment, your DMS GP will refer you through the NHS.
                  </p>

                    <p>
                      You may go on waiting lists before you can get treatment.

                      <h3>Pregnancy and fertility support</h3>

                      <p>
                        It is important to know what options you have and actions you can take if you or your partner are either pregnant or looking to get pregnant while in the armed forces.
                        </p>
