        Mental health problems such as depression or self-harm can affect any of us, but they're more common among people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT).</p></strong>

     <p>This may be linked to LGBT people&#x27;s experience of discrimination, homophobia or transphobia, bullying, social isolation, or rejection because of their sexuality.</p>
     <p>Other things, such as their age, religion, where they live, and their ethnicity can add extra complications to an already difficult situation.</p>
     
     <h2>How talking therapy can help</h2>
