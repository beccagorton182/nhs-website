<h2>What happens to my healthcare when I leave the armed forces?</h2>

<p>
After your discharge date, you will move from dedicated serving personnel healthcare to civilian and veteran healthcare.
 </p>

 <p>
   Most of your treatment will come through <a href="nhs-services">NHS services</a>, which includes dedicated <a href="veterans">healthcare services designed to support veterans</a>.
   </p>

   <p>
     Some of these services may already provide treatment to you during your discharge period.
     </p>

     <p>
       <a href="../level-3/mental-health-veterans">There are also services that support veterans mental health. </a>
       </p>

       <h2>Actions to take when moving to civilian healthcare</h2>

       <p>
     If you are unsure of what to do when you leave the armed forces, there are several actions you can take to make your transition from military to civilian healthcare a lot easier.

     <h3>Collect your medical records and documents</h3>

     <p>
You can get 3 documents when leaving the armed forces that can help continue your healthcare without disadvantage. These are:
       </p>

       <ul>
         <li>
           an NHS welcome letter that explains the process of transferring from military healthcare to an NHS GP surgery and civilian dentist, as well as information on what a GP can do to help you as a veteran
           </li>
           <li>
             a form (FMed133A) that includes important details for your GP surgery, including a summary of medical treatments, vaccinations and specialist care received
             </li>
             <li>
               a paper copy of your summary medical records, which contains more detailed information about the medical treatment you have received while in the armed forces
               </li>
         </ul>

         <p>
           You will usually receive the NHS welcome letter and the form during your final medical assessment at the end of your discharge period. If you do not receive them, ask a doctor at a medical centre to get them for you as soon as possible.
           </p>

           <p>
             You will not usually be given a paper copy of your summary medical records unless you ask a doctor at your medical centre. It is better to ask for this earlier in your discharge period as it may take a while to arrive if they agree to provide a copy.
             </p>

             <h3>Talk to a medical officer about continuing treatment</h3>

             <p>
               If you receive specialist healthcare treatment or are medically discharged, it is important to ask a medical officer about how you can continue your treatment after your discharge date.
               </p>

               <p>
                 There are services who can provide support and treatment to you during your discharge period and after your discharge date. These include:
                 </p>

                 <ul>
                   <li>
                     the Veterans Trauma Network, for physical injuries caused during service
                     </li>
                     <li>
                       Op COURAGE: the Veterans Mental Health and Wellbeing Service
                       </li>
                   </ul>

                   <p>

Ask a medical officer about getting a referral to these services if you need them.

                         <p>
                           The NHS welcome letter you received during your discharge will encourage you to register with an NHS GP surgery.
                           </p>

                     <p>
                       It is recommended you register with a GP 1 to 3 months before you are discharged, or as soon as possible after this if you have not already.
                       </p>

                       <p>
                         If you register early, your GP surgery can request your complete medical records from Defence Medical Services (DMS). This may happen before you have been discharged. This means they can treat you using your full military medical record sooner after your discharge.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                           It usually takes several months for your GP surgery to receive your full military medical records.
                           </p>

                           <p>
                             Your GP surgery will automatically receive any previous NHS medical records you may have when you register.
                             </p>

                         <p>
                           Once your GP surgery has your full records, a GP can give you better healthcare advice, as well as quickly refer you to any specialist care you might need.
                           </p>

                           <h3>Help your GP access your military medical records</h3>

                           <p>
                             When you first visit a GP at your GP surgery, it is important to give them the medical summary form (FMed133A) you received when you were discharged from the armed forces.This form includes the details needed for them to request your complete medical records from DMS.
                             </p>

                             <p>
                               It is important to ask a GP to request your complete medical records if they do not already know to do so.
                               </p>

                             <p>
                               You can also give them a paper copy of your summary medical records if you asked for one during your discharge period. They might need this if they do not have access to your full military medical records yet.
                               </p>

                               <p>
                                 Once a GP has your complete medical records, they will be aware of your medical history and can give you the healthcare treatment you need.
                                 </p>



                               <p>
                                 You can also give them your NHS welcome letter. This provides information to them about how to help you.

                     <h3>Tell a GP to record you as a veteran in your NHS medical notes</h3>

                     <p>
                       When you first visit your GP surgery, it is important to tell the GP you see that you are a veteran.
                       </p>

                       <p>
                         Ask them to record this in your NHS medical notes if it is not already there. They can do this by putting a specific code that represents veterans into your medical records.
                         </p>

                       <p>
                         Being flagged as a veteran means you are more likely to receive specialist veteran care and consideration, and GPs are able to refer you to specialist veteran services if you need them.
                         </p>

                         <h3>Register with a dentist</h3>

                         <p>
                           Your NHS welcome letter will also encourage you to find a dentist.
                           </p>

                           <p>
                             It is important to do this as soon as possible.
