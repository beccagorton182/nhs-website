        University can be a stressful experience, as well as being fun and exciting. You may feel stressed about starting university, exams, coursework deadlines, living with people you do not get on with, or thinking about the future.</p></strong>

     <p><a href="javascript:void(0)">Stress</a> is a natural feeling, designed to help you cope in challenging situations. In small amounts it can be good, because it pushes you to work hard and do your best, such as during exams.</p>
     <p>But if you&#x27;re feeling very stressed or feel you cannot manage stress, it can lead to mental health problems such as <a href="low-mood">depression</a> and <a href="anxiety-fear-panic">anxiety</a>. It can also affect your academic performance.</p>
     <p>Leaving home to start your studies can involve some stressful changes. These might include moving to a new area, meeting new people and managing on a tight budget.</p>
     
     <h2>Signs you might be stressed</h2>
     <p>There are lots of possible signs of stress.</p>
     <p>Stress can make you feel:</p>

       <li>anxious</li>
       <li>like you cannot enjoy yourself</li>
       <li>worried a lot of the time</li>
      </ul>

        <h2>Things that can help with stress</h2>
        <p>Short periods of stress are normal and can often be resolved by something as simple as completing a task which cuts down your workload, or by talking to others and taking time to relax.</p>
