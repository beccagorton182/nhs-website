      <h2>What's changed?</h2>
      <p>We created some experimental designs to test reaction to capacity status/waiting times and a new page if we had more information for outside of England users.</p>
    <p>Second release was decided and we looked to test displaying more than one result, re-introducing use my location and increasing trust in why we are asking for location.</p>
    <p>We added new H1s that adhere closer to the service manual guidance. </p>

<h3>How might we questions</h3>
<ul class="nhsuk-list--bullet">
<li>How might we better manage user expectations?</li>
<li>How might we include results for users outside of England?</li>
<li>How might we address and support parents and carers?</li>
<li>How might we reassure users to trust our service?</li>
<li>How might we display more than one result to users?</li>
<li>How might we join up other journeys into the finder?</li>


</ul>

<h3>Design challenges</h3>
<ul class="nhsuk-list--bullet">
<li>Hint text is being missed but this information is too important for expanders </li>
<li>Making two results work and making it clear they're separate services</li>
<li>Where to put extra text that might be really reasssuring for people but not overload a page with information</li>

</ul>

<h3>Hypotheses</h3>
<ul class="nhsuk-list--number">
<li>We believe users outside of England will be able to see which helpline is relevant for them in a list</li>
<li>We believe putting capacity information below the phone number will not deter users from making a call, but might make them reconsider if they notice it</li>
<li>We believe addressing parents and carers directly about accessing young people only services, they will know that they can access them on behalf of a young person</li>
<li>We believe listing more than one helpline will confuse or overwhelm users because their cognitive load would be reduced in a crisis</li>
<li>We believe putting privacy concerns in expanders will mean users know where to find their answers</li>
<li>We believe if we shorten H1 questions, users will feel triggered by these and are less likely to trust the service</li>
<li>We believe users do not trust the use my location function</li>
</ul>

      <h3>Main outcomes</h3>
      
      <ul class="nhsuk-list--number">
        <li>Users would find it useful to have individual pages for outside of England results</li>
        <li>Users would still call the number even if it was busy - unless it was urgent</li>
        <li>Users thought it was helpful to have alternative services displayed if the line was busy</li>
        <li>Users were either overwhelmed or confused by the two results, and were not sure which one they needed to use</li>
        <li>Users were suspicious or not trusting of the use my location button</li>
        <li>Some users were uncertain about the new H1s, often putting their own ages in when the task was for somebody else</li>
        <li>Users found the panel design clearer, but not when there was more than one result</li>
        </ul>
