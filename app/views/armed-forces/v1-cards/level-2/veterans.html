Find healthcare and welfare support dedicated to veterans, non-mobilised reservists, families and carers.     </p>

<p>
  You are a veteran if you have actively served in the armed forces for at least 1 day. Reservists who are not currently mobilised are also given the status of veteran until they return to actively serving.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are a reservist who is currently actively serving, find information about your healthcare on the <a href="serving-personnel">healthcare for serving personnel page</a>.
    </p>

  <p>
    All veterans, family members and carers can access a range of specialist healthcare and support created to provide treatment and care for many different problems.
    </p>

    <h2>Support for health problems not caused by service</h2>

    <p>
      If you have a new or existing health problem that is not caused by your time in the armed forces, you can use regular NHS services to get treatment.
      </p>

      <!-- <p>
        You will only be able to use to specialist veteran services if your health problem was caused by your time in the armed forces.
        </p> -->

        <p>
          It is important to <a href="../../register-gp">register with a GP surgery</a> once you have left the armed forces and to tell them you have served. A GP can help refer you to NHS or dedicated veteran specialist services.

                <h3>Waiting lists and priority treatment</h3>

                <p>
                  If you have a health problem not caused by your time in the armed forces, you may go on to a waiting list before you can receive full treatment from the NHS. This is the usual process for NHS treatment.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    If you have a health problem caused by your time in the armed forces, you will usually go on a waiting list before you receive care. However, you may be able to receive NHS care quicker than normal through priority treatment for veterans.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Priority treatment is not guaranteed. Receiving priority treatment depends on your situation and the nature of the treatment required. This includes:
                      </p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          if other people have a higher clinical need than you
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            the urgency of your treatment
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              the type of treatment you need
                              </li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>
                      Check with a GP if you can receive priority treatment for the NHS service care you need.
                      </p>
