          <h3>Talk to someone you trust</h3>

          <p>Let family or friends know what's going on for you. They may be able to offer support and help keep you safe.</p>
          <p>There's no right or wrong way to talk about suicidal feelings – starting the conversation is what's important.</p>

          <h3>Who else can you talk to</h3>

          <p>If you find it difficult to talk to someone you know, you could:</p>
          <ul><li><b>call your GP</b> – ask for an emergency appointment</li>
            <li><b>call 111</b> out of hours – they will help you find the support and help you need</li>
            <li><b>contact your mental health crisis team</b> – if you have one</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="nhsuk-warning-callout">
            <h3 class="nhsuk-warning-callout__label">Important</h3>
            <h2>Is your life in danger?</h2><p>If you have seriously harmed yourself – for example, by taking a drug overdose – call 999 for an ambulance or go straight to A&amp;E.</p><p>Or ask someone else to call 999 or take you to A&amp;E.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Tips for coping right now</h3>
          <ul><li>try not to think about the future – just focus on getting through today</li>
            <li>stay away from drugs and alcohol</li>
            <li>get yourself to a safe place, like a friend's house</li>
            <li>be around other people</li>
            <li>do something you usually enjoy, such as spending time with a pet</li></ul>

            <h3>Worried about someone else?</h3>
            <p>If you're worried about someone, try to get them to talk to you. Ask open-ended questions like: "How do you feel about...?"</p>
            <p>Don't worry about having the answers. Just listening to what someone has to say and taking it seriously can be more helpful.</p>
